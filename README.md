## Description
README file for assignments in SSW 567
### Assignment 1 Deliverable 3
Challenges: 
- Learning the syntax for unit testing in python was challenging because I am used to unit testing in Java.
- Getting used to Git commands again after using Visual Studio source control framework all summer was challenging.

I think the requirements for this assignment were a bit generic. I would have liked more specification on the desired output for the program.

I didn't face many challenges using the tools, besided getting used to the syntax.

I determined I had sufficient test cases when all of the key functionality was tested for accuracy.
